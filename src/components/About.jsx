              With a background in <strong>Food Science & Technology</strong> and recent completion of a 
              comprehensive <strong>full-stack software engineering bootcamp</strong>, I bring a unique 
              perspective that bridges scientific rigor with modern technology solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              My academic background in food science has equipped me with exceptional 
              <strong> analytical thinking</strong>, <strong>attention to detail</strong>, <strong>product development</strong>, <strong>quality assurance</strong>, and 
              <strong> research methodologies</strong> that translate seamlessly into software development. 
              The systematic approach to problem-solving, data analysis, and process optimization 
              I developed in the lab now drives my approach to building efficient, scalable applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through intensive training in <strong> HTML,CSS,JavaScript, React, Python, and Flask</strong>, 
              I've developed expertise in creating full-stack web applications with robust database 
              systems. My scientific background enhances my ability to approach complex technical 
              challenges methodically, ensuring clean, well-documented code and thorough testing procedures.
